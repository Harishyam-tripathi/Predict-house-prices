**🏡 Predict House Price**
**📌 Overview**

***This project builds a Linear Regression Model to predict house prices using features like Size, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, and Location.***

**⚙️ Steps**

**Data Cleaning → Handle missing values & outliers
EDA → Visualize trends (scatter plots, heatmaps)
Model Training → Linear Regression with scikit-learn
Evaluation → RMSE & R² score**

**📊 Deliverables**

**Visualizations (scatter plots, correlation heatmap)
Trained Linear Regression model
Evaluation metrics (RMSE, R²)
Insights: Size & Location are key predictors**
